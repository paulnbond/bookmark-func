# Bookmark Fun

**--Disclaimer--
You should absolutely never run any code you find on the web unless you fully understand it. I can confirm that the code I have written in this repository has no malicious intent. However it is my duty to insist you do not run any code you do not fully understand.**

A bunch of JavaScript functions to add to bookmarks so that they can be easily run on web pages.

## Installation
1. In your web browser of choice, create a new bookmark.
2. Give it whichever name you want.
3. Paste in the minified Javascript code as the URL.
4. Now when you click the bookmark, the code will run!
