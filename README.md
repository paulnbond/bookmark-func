# Bookmark Fun

**--Disclaimer--
You should absolutely never run JavaScript functions you find on the web unless you fully understand them.**

A bunch of JavaScript functions to add to bookmarks so that they can be easily run on web pages.

## Installation
1. In your web browser of choice, create a new bookmark.
2. Give it whichever name you want.
3. Paste in the minified Javascript code as the URL.
4. Now when you click the bookmark, the code will run!
